Part 1: Project Context and Initial Data Insights (7 min)
- Introduction to the Project: Objectives, societal significance, and long-term goals of analyzing road accident data in France.
- Dataset and Scope: Details about the dataset (sources, years considered, key variables) and decision to focus on data from 2019-2022.
- Preliminary Insights:
  - Summary of accident distribution (severity levels, temporal trends).
  - Key variables like lighting, speed, and user demographics.
  - Visualizations and early patterns (e.g., rural vs. urban accident trends, impact of safety equipment).

 Part 2: Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering (7 min)
- Data Cleaning:
  - Handling missing and inconsistent values.
  - Outlier treatment and dataset merging (e.g., combining accident, vehicle, and user data).
- Feature Transformation:
  - Encoding techniques for categorical data.
  - Cyclical encoding for temporal variables.
  - Latitude/longitude standardization.
- Preprocessed Dataset Insights:
  - Examples of improved dataset structure and readiness for modeling.
  - Insights gained from exploratory statistics after cleaning.

 Part 3: Modeling, Results, and Future Work (7 min)
- Modeling Process:
  - Overview of machine learning approaches (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).
  - Steps for training, validation, and hyperparameter tuning.
- Performance Summary:
  - Simplified results highlighting model accuracy for different severity classes.
  - Challenges with imbalanced classes and model limitations.
- Practical Implications and Next Steps:
  - Policy recommendations based on findings (e.g., speed regulation, infrastructure improvements).
