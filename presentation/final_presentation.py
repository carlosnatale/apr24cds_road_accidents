This can lead to improved predictions of the likelihood of road accidents and their severity. We will also utilize advanced data analytics techniques, such as machine learning, to build predictive models and derive actionable insights.")

    st.write("In the long term, this analysis could bring economic benefits to both the population of France and the French government. The reduction of accidents or their severity would have far-reaching benefits due to the socio-economic impact of road accidents, such as road closures, injuries, or even death. Accident prevention will help reduce healthcare costs, alleviate the financial burden on victims and their families, and minimize the economic impact of traffic disruptions. Furthermore, enhanced road safety will lead to increased productivity and economic efficiency.")
